description: 'We present an electrophysiological dataset recorded from thirteen subjects
  during a visual working memory task. Subjects were epilepsy patients undergoing
  intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Here, we recorded
  single neuron firing in 13 epilepsy patients (7 male) while they performed a visual
  working memory task. The task is a change detection task designed to examine the
  visual working memory of subjects. In each trial, arrays of colored squares were
  presented and had to be memorized. The number of squares determined the set size:
  1, 2, 4 or 6. There was a total 192 trials per session. Each trial started with
  a warning signal (0.4 s) that was a red fixation dot. The fixation dot was then
  changed to black (0.4 – 0.5 s, jittered). A memory array (encoding period, 0.8 s)
  was followed by a delay (retention interval, 0.9 s). After the delay, a test array
  was shown (2 s) followed by a jittered inter-trial interval of 1.3 to 2.3 s. The
  participants indicated by button press (“Same” or “Different”, forced choice) whether
  the test array differed from the memory array. If the arrays differed, only one
  square changed in colour, but all squares remained on the same location. The fixation
  dot was visible on the screen during the whole trial period. Eight different colours
  were used for the memory and test array (yellow, red, green, blue, magenta, cyan,
  grey, black). Before starting the sessions, participants conducted trial runs in
  a practice session to learn the task. In this session we verified if participants
  were colour-blind and could discriminate all colours. Practice sessions were repeated
  until the participant understood the task and was able to follow the pace of the
  trials.'
